Bank Loan Prediction
•	Developed a comprehensive bank loan prediction program utilizing Python and key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze data and make accurate predictions on loan applications.
•	Imported a dataset, cleaned the data by removing null values and replacing them with mode, then split the dataset into training and test datasets to ensure accurate model training.
•	Utilized decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest algorithms to effectively classify loan applications, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 90% across all models.
